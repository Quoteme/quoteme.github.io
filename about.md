I am Luca Leon Happel, a 23-year-old Student in Düsseldorf and a [top-100](https://xscode.com/profile/quoteme) on [GitHub](https://xscode.com/profile/quoteme) in
categories like physics-engines and rigid-body-dynamics.
My interests include mathematics,
computer science, technology and lots more.
My friends and colleagues primarily know me for the extra mile I always
put into my work to help them and myself.
