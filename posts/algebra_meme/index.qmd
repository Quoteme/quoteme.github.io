A few minutes ago I stumbled upon this meme on some math and science
forum:

![Prove that Rx/(x^2+bx+c) is isomorphic to R^2 or C](https://i.imgur.com/5gUWnRL.png)

Here is my thought process:

$b^2-4c$ is just the [discriminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminant)
of the polynomial $f(x) = x^2+bx+c$, and I will refer to it from now
on as $\Delta(f)$.

We know that if $\Delta(f)>0$ then the formula
$\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4c}}{2} = -\frac{b}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2 - c}$
gives us the zeros $x_1, x_2 \in \mathbb{R}$ of $f$. Let's look
at $\mathbb{R}[x] / (f)$. And identify each part now.

- The [principal ideal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_ideal)
  $(f) \overbrace{=}^{\mathbb{R}[x] \text{ commutative}} \{ p(x)\cdot \underbrace{f(x)}_{x^2+bx+c \\ = (x-x_1)(x-x_2) } \mid p(x) \in \mathbb{R}[x]\}$

- The [quotient ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_ring)
  $\mathbb{R} [x]/(f)$, which is the same as $\mathbb{R}[x]/\sim$ where
  $\sim$ is an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation):
  $a\sim b \Leftrightarrow a-b \in (f)$

  When performing polynomial division $\frac{p(x)}{f(x)}, \> p(x)\in\mathbb{R}[x]$
  if $\deg(p(x))>2$ we can always perform at least one step and
  the remainder must be of the form $ax+b \in \mathbb{R}[x]/(f)$
