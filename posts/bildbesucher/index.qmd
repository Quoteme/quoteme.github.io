Recently, I've started to develop a game again, finding a bit of a positive side during the current Corona crisis.

I've named the game "BildBesucher," which is centered around the idea of exploring online images with a small character, moving from one picture to the next. This concept was inspired by my experience playing XKCD's "Hoverboard" (XKCD Hoverboard), which I greatly enjoyed. You can view and even fork the source code on the corresponding Github page.

There are quite a few plans for the game's development. A key priority is to add a zoom function to the in-game camera soon, so players can discover more about the drawn world. Other important features I want to work on include:

- A portal system for navigating to different pages at specific points.
- A loading system to load specific levels via URL, with various properties like position and so on.
- Expanding the world further by creating more images and enhancing the existing ones.
- ???

PS: I hope to make more progress with my game this time around.
