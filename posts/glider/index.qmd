Today, while revisiting my old laptop, I rediscovered a project from just over a year and a month ago:

Named [Glider](https://github.com/Quoteme/glider), this project can be experienced and played directly in a web browser, without any need for installation, at [http://quoteme.github.io/glider/](http://quoteme.github.io/glider/).

The core intention of Glider was to serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating my capability to recreate a game akin to [LUFTRAUSERS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233150/LUFTRAUSERS/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1). Although my version, the "clone", offers a limited range of functions, it successfully fulfills the objective I set out to achieve.

Key features include:

A retro aesthetic
Sophisticated enemy AI
The option to choose from varying team numbers
The facility to take control of any other glider in the game.
