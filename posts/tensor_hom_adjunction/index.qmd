As I often tend to do, I read a few articles about math (category theory and
algebra in particual) on Wikipedia. Again, I stumbled upon the article of 
[Coalgebras][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalgebra]. Especially the
$\Delta:C \to C\otimes C $ seemed sus to me.

In a $K$-algebra, I have a clear feel about what the dual map $(\cdot):C\otimes C \to C$
does. But in a coalgebra? This most likely is just a result of my inexperience
with coalgebras, but I wanted to understand this better.

## Coalgebras formed as duals of finite dimensional algebras

My first step to get a better understanding of coalgebras was to look at the
coalgebra that is dual to a finite dimensional algebra. My favorite ones are
the unital associative algebras [Clifford algebras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_algebra),
for which $\mathbb{C}$, $\mathbb{R}[\epsilon]/(\epsilon^2)$ and the exterior
algebras over some field $K$ are examples. I like these algebras most, because I
have previously written about them: [my post about differential forms](../differential_forms/) which includes exterior algebras, and
[my post about the dual numbers]( ../algebra_meme_2/ ).
After I played around with these algebras a bit, I realized that their duals
(which are coalgebras) are actually quite simple to understand. In particular,
using the [Tensor-Hom adjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor%E2%80%93hom_adjunction)
(which is basically just gloryfied currying in the category of $R$-modules?),
we can even get some neat insights into the coalgebra structure.
This technique works for any finite dimensional algebra:

Let $F\in (\text{Field})$ and $U,V,W\in(\text{FinVec}_F)$, where $(\text{FinVec}_F)$
is the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over $F$.
Then we have the following adjunction:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Hom}(U\otimes V,W) &\cong \text{Hom}(U,\text{Hom}(V,W)) \\
\end{align*}
$$

We may choose $V=U=W$ and in this case we get the adjunction
$\text{Hom}(V\otimes V,V) \cong \text{Hom}(V,\text{Hom}(V,V))$.

Let us now take a look at the dual $C=V^*$ of $V$. This is a
coalgebra and because $V$ is finite dimensional, we can have a equip it with a
basis: the dual basis $\{e_i^*\}_{i\in I}$, where $e_i$ is a basis of $V$.

Now, $\Delta:C \to C\otimes C$ is the map that satisfies the following
commutative diagrams:

Clearly, because $C$ is again a finite dimensional vector space, we can use the
adjunction to rewrite the map $\Delta$ as follows:
