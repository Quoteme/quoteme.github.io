You have tested it, you have written unit tests, but still, you are not sure. You are not sure if your code is correct. This is where formal verification comes in. Formal verification is the process of proving that a program is correct. This can be done in many ways, but one of the most interesting ways is automated theorem proving. In this article, I will provide a glimpse into automated theorem proving and show you how to use the Lean4 programming language to prove theorems. This is not really intended as an introduction to Lean4 or automated theorem proving, but rather as a demonstration of what I learned after half holding a seminar about it, attending half a year of a course about it at the [university of Düsseldorf](https://www.hhu.de/) and particiating at the conference [Lean for the Curious Mathematician 2023](https://lftcm2023.github.io/).\n\n## From functional programming to automated theorem proving\n\nLean4 is a functional programming language. This means that it is a programming language that is based on the $\\lambda$-calculus. The $\\lambda$-calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. In Lean4, we write programs by defining functions, composing them in clever ways and finally applying them to specific arguemnts. In this regard, Lean4 is very similar to [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/), about which [I held a talk a year ago](posts/bachelor-seminar-haskell/).\n\nBy enriching the $\\lambda$-calculus with a sufficiently strong type system like in Lean4, we can use the resulting programming language to write programs that are provably correct. The foundation of this is the [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence), whose motto is \"propositions as types, proofs as terms\". In $\\lambda$-calculus, terms are well-defined mathematical objects as are types.\n\nA quick example of the power that a strong type system provides us with would be the following Lean4 code snippet:\n\n```{lean4}\ndef swap {α β : Type} (p : α × β) : β × α := (p.snd, p.fst)\n\ntheorem swap_swap {α β : Type} (p : α × β) : swap (swap p) = p :=\n  match p with\n  | (a, b) => rfl\n```\n\nHere we define a function `swap` that swaps the elements of a pair. We then prove that `swap` is involutive, i.e. that `swap (swap p) = p` for all pairs `p`. The `theorem` keyword is used to define a theorem, but is just syntactic sugar for defining a function that represents a proof. Notice that we state our theorem using Lean4's type system and then provide a proof using Lean4's programming language. The proof is verified by the Lean4 compiler, which checks if each step in the program has valid types. If we were to change the proof to the following:\n\n```{lean4}\ntheorem swap_swap {α β : Type} (p : α × β) : swap (swap p) ≠ p :=\n  match p with\n  | (a, b) => rfl\n```\n\nThe Lean4 compiler would throw the following error regarding the `rlf` function:\n\n```{lean4}\ntype mismatch\n  rfl\nhas type\n  ?m.149 = ?m.149 : Prop\nbut is expected to have type\n  swap (swap (a, b)) ≠ (a, b) : Prop\n```\n\nNotice that the error message is very helpful (if you know how to decode it) and it tells us exactly what went wrong. It tells us that `rfl` (the reflexivity axiom, which states that for all $a$, we have $a=a$) has type `?m.149 = ?m.149 : Prop`, but the term we provided has type `swap (swap (a, b)) ≠ (a, b) : Prop`. We did not get this error message previously, because previously we wanted to show that `swap (swap p) = p`, which we did by unfolding the definition of `swap` using the `match` keyword and then using the `rfl` function to show that `(a,b) = (a,b)`. This last step is where everything went wrong in the second proof. After unpacking we get `swap (swap (a, b)) = (a, b)`, and now by applying `rfl` we get a term `(a,b) = (a,b)`, which is not what we wanted to show. We wanted to show that `swap (swap (a, b)) ≠ (a, b)`, which is not true, and thus we get a type error.\n\n### Untyped $\\lambda$-calculus\n\nLet $V = \\{x,y,z, \\dots\\}$ be a set, which we call the set of variables and let $K = \\{\\a,\\b,\\f,\\g, \\dots\\}$ be a set, which we call the set of constants. We can now define the set of terms $\\Lambda$ _inductively_ as follows:\n\n| Rule                                                               | Name        |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |\n| If $x \\in V$, then $x \\in \\Lambda$                                 | Variable    |\n| If $\\f \\in K$, then $\\f \\in \\Lambda$                               | Constant    |\n| If $s,t \\in \\Lambda$, then $(st) \\in \\Lambda$                      | Application |\n| If $x \\in V$ and $t \\in \\Lambda$, then $(\\lambda x.t) \\in \\Lambda$ | Abstraction |\n\nUsing the notation of the [Backus–Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form), we can define $\\Lambda$ succinctly as follows:\n\n$$\n\\Lambda ::= V \\mid K \\mid \\Lambda \\Lambda \\mid \\lambda V.\\Lambda\n$$\n\nThis strongly resembles the [syntax of Lean4](https://leanprover.github.io/functional_programming_in_lean/getting-to-know/datatypes-and-patterns.html) and also [that of Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Type).\n\n### Simply typed $\\lambda$-calculus\n\nIn the simply typed $\\lambda$-calculus, we enrich the untyped $\\lambda$-calculus with a type system. We define the set of types $\\T$ _inductively_ using a set of _base types_ $\\T_0$ as follows:\n\n1. If $A \\in \\T_0$, then $A \\in \\T$\n2. If $A,B \\in \\T$, then $A \\to B \\in \\T$\n\nUsing the notation of the [Backus–Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form) again, we can define $\\T$ succinctly as follows:\n\n$$\n\\T ::= \\T_0 \\mid \\T \\to \\T\n$$\n\nUsing the set of types $\\T$, we can now define the set of typed terms $\\Lambda_\\T$ _inductively_ using the Backus–Naur form as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Lambda_\\T &::= V \\mid K \\mid \\Lambda_\\T \\Lambda_\\T \\mid \\lambda V:\\T.\\Lambda_\\T \\\\\n           & \\text{where } \\\\\n           & V \\text{ is the infinite set of variables } \\\\\n           & K \\text{ is the set of constants } \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n### Type inference\n\nUsing typed $\\lambda$-calculus as a basis for our programming language, we can now associate a type with each valid term. For example:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n(+1) &= \\lambda x : \\N \\to \\N. x+1 & : \\N \\to \\N \\\\\n\\text{hello} &= \\text{IO.println} \\, \\text{\"Hello, world!\"} & : \\text{IO} \\, \\text{Unit} \\\\\n\\f &= \\lambda \\g : \\alpha \\to \\alpha. g \\, g & : (\\alpha \\to \\alpha) \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNot all terms have a type, however. For example, assume $\\a, \\b \\in K$ are some constants. We say, that our _context_ $\\Gamma$ consists of $\\a, \\b : \\kappa$, denoted as $\\Gamma, \\, \\a, \\b : \\kappa$, say in the context $\\Gamma$, it holds that $\\a, \\b$ are of type $\\kappa$. Then the term $\\a \\b$ does not have a type, because we cannot infer a type for $\\a$ and $\\b$, as we cannot apply $\\a$ to $\\b$.\n\nLean4 and other programming languages with sufficiently strong type systems can infer the type of a term. This is called _type inference_. For example, in Lean4, we can write the following code:\n\n```{lean4}\ndef f x := x + 1\n```\n\nThis snippet defines a function `f` that takes an argument `x` and returns `x + 1`. We did not specify the type of `x`, but Lean4 can infer that `x` is of type `ℕ`, because we used `1`, which is of type `ℕ`, in the expression `x + 1` and if the second parameter of the `+` function is of type `ℕ`, then the first parameter must also be of type `ℕ` (although this is not true in general, but we do not care about this here).\n\nImplicitly we used the context $\\Gamma$, such that `1:ℕ`. To achieve a fully sound and rigorous type inference, we would have to specify the context $\\Gamma$ beforehand and we need to define some general rules for type inference. These rules are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Konst} & \\frac{}{\\Gamma \\vdash \\a : \\kappa} & \\text{if } \\Gamma, \\a : \\kappa \\\\\n\\text{Var} & \\frac{\\Gamma, \\, x : \\tau \\vdash t : \\sigma}{\\Gamma \\vdash \\lambda x : \\tau.t : \\tau \\to \\sigma} \\\\\n\\text{App} & \\frac{\\Gamma \\vdash t : \\sigma \\to \\tau \\quad \\Gamma \\vdash s : \\sigma}{\\Gamma \\vdash t \\, s : \\tau} \\\\\n\\text{Abs} & \\frac{\\Gamma, \\, x : \\tau \\vdash t : \\sigma}{\\Gamma \\vdash ( \\lambda x : \\tau.t ) : \\tau \\to \\sigma} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\n### Type Inference Example\n\nA simple example of type inference would be the following:\n\nConsider the term $\\lambda x. x + 1$. To determine its type under the context $\\Gamma$, we use the rules of type inference as outlined above. Let's break down the process step by step.\n\n1. Variable Rule (Var):\n\n  The term is an abstraction $\\lambda x.t$ where $t = x + 1$.\n  We assume $x : \\N$ as part of our context for the body $t$ of the abstraction. This is because we are dealing with addition and the constant 1 is of type $\\N$.\n\n2. Application Rule (App):\n\n  The subterm $x + 1$ is an application of the addition function to $x$ and $1$.\n  In $\\Gamma$, the addition function has the type $\\N \\to \\N \\to \\N$. This means it takes two arguments of type $\\N$ and returns a result of type $\\N$.\n  Since $x : \\N$ and $1 : \\N$, the term $x + 1$ is well-typed and has the type $\\N$.\n\n3. Abstraction Rule (Abs):\n\n  We now return to our original term $\\lambda x. x + 1$.\n  Since the body of the abstraction $x + 1$ has type $\\N$ and we assumed $x : \\N$, the whole abstraction has the type $\\N \\to \\N$.\n  Therefore, the term $\\lambda x. x + 1$ is well-typed under the context $\\Gamma$ and has the type $\\N \\to \\N$. This represents a function that takes a natural number as input and returns a natural number as output.\n\nThis results in the following derivation:\n\n",
